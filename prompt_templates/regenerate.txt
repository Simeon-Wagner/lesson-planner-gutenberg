You have provided me following lesson plan lesson plan for secondary school in Uganda for the topic below and based on the provided context:
<topic>
{input}
</topic>

<context>
{context}
</context>

<lesson_plan>
{lp}
</lesson_plan>

As learning objective, I asked you to consider these ones provided here (below). You can adapt them slightly to fit better to the provided context or make them gramatically correct.
Please also add new learning objective so that there are at least three.
<learning_objectives>
{learningObjectives}
</learning_objectives>

I also asked you to consider the class size, and state how you considered it.
<class_size>
{class_size}
</class_size>

For class sizes <30 you can use activities that include presentation afterwards.
For class sizes from 30-60 you might still have group work, but presentation must be suitable for many students.
For class sizes >60, think of alternative ways of engaging the students into discussion.

Now adapt this lesson plan, so that it focusses more on: "{focusMoreOn}" and that it focuses less on: "{focusLessOn}".

Make sure, that you still stick to the provided format and the html tags remain.
